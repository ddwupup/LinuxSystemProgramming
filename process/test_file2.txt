In Eco-translatology, the theory of translation as adaptation and selection defines translation as a kind of selective activity. And during the process, translators try to make the translation adapt to the eco-environment. The Eco-translatology can provide multiple perspectives for the translation of advertisements. This paper studies the importance of the target language environment and how to make use of the multi-dimensional conversion to make translation better adapt to the target language environment. When analyzing and having an intimate knowledge of Eco-translatology, it is easy to see how to understand and cope with the differences between Chinese and English, how to replace some Chinese images with English ones, so that stimulate the desire of consumers to buy and fit the expected requirements of advertisements.
